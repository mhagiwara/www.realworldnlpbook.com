There is this article titled [Tackle the monkey first](https://blog.x.company/tackle-the-monkey-first-90fd6223e04d) written by Astro Teller, who leads Google's moonshot lab "X." The article begins "Let’s say you’re trying to teach a monkey how to recite Shakespeare while on a pedestal. How should you allocate your time and money between training the monkey and building the pedestal?"

The moral of the story is that you should spend zero time building the pedestal and focus on the most difficult part, which is training the Shakespeare reciting monkey, although many people tend to rush off and start building the pedestal instead just to have a sense of progress and to have at least something to show to their boss. A Shakespeare reciting monkey without a pedestal is still an incredible achievement, while a pedestal is just a pedestal without the monkey.

I just love this article—I can't remember how many times I was tempted to "build the pedestal" first when I had choices between projects or some components and I realized I was about to do something easier instead of tackling the most difficult part. Re-reading this article almost always helps me go back on track. "When in doubt, do something more difficult." is one of my life mottoes. In fact, I liked this article so much that now I write "tackle the monkey first" at the top of my to-do list to constantly remind me of the most important thing every day.

So, I decided to tackle the monkey first.

I don't know where Astro Teller got the inspiration of Shakespeare reciting monkeys, the concept is not new.
